MODESTMAIL

This simple mailing program was designed for a CS300 assignment at Portland
State University Fall 2010 with Bart Massey.

For help installing, please see INSTALL.

For help running, please see HELP.

For sending to a custom mail host, simply create a file called
    modestmail.conf
in the application directory, and add this line to the file somewhere
    HOST = www.example.com
replacing www.example.com with the desired mail host.
Note: this file will be automatically created when you first run the
application.

INSTALL

To build and use ModestMail type the following command:

    make

That compiles the program into the executable modestmail. Then you can type:

    ./modestmail

That starts the program. You'll notice this command actually won't do anything.
You can either specify a <filename> or simply type:

    ./modestmail --help

That will give more information.
